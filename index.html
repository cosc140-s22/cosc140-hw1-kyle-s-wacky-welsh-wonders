      <p>My favorite things to do when I am abroad are visit new places, try new foods (or old ones with a different twist), and learn more about the unique backgrounds that define Welsh culture. Here is what I have done so far!</p>

            <td>Great Caribbean food! Chicken and hot sauce were delicious. I wish I had tried the coconut rice. I wasn’t a fan of the salad, however.</td>

            <td>Juboraj</td>
            <td>Bit of a hike to get there, but once arrived the food was amazing! Though I wish the chicken pakora was bigger, the vindaloo and pilaf rice were decadent! Would recommend this to other Colgate students.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Masala Bag</td>
            <td>Gross. This is like the English-Indian Burger King. The Chicken Tikka Masala was sweet (it isn't a sweet curry!), the garlic naan was generic, and there may have been a rock in my Bhatura curry. The worst Indian food I've ever had.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Slim Chickens</td>
            <td>Basically like if KFC was better. I had some inferno sauce wings with fries and chicken tenders, and it was pretty good. Wanted some fried food, got some decent fried food.</td>

            <td>Zizzi's</td>

    <h3>During my time here, I have learned some interesting facts about Cardiff, Wales, and the UK. Here are four of my favorite ones!</h3>
      <ol class="ls">
        <li>Cardiff is home to many famous celebrities, including Roald Dahl, Ken Follett, Henry Morgan, and even the group Underworld.</li>
        <li>Welsh, also known as British, is one of the oldest speaking languages in Europe.</li>
        <li>There are multiple reasons why the UK receives a lot of rain compared to other places. The UK is located at a high latitude and is in the path of the North Atlantic Current, a powerful water current that transports warm water up to the isles from the Gulf of Mexico. Paired with a combination of winds coming from all cardinal directions makes the weather cool, wet, and temperate. 
          <ul>
            <li>For more information <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zpykxsg/revision/4"> here's the BBC talking about the UK weather.</a></li>
          </ul>
        <li>Slate and coal mining were very large contributors to the Welsh economy, and as a result there are large piles of slate all across the country.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Places to Visit</h3>
    <p>There are a number of places I wish to visit around the UK. Within Cardiff, I have yet to visit the iconic Cardiff Castle or head down to the bay. The Castle would be a fun daytrip to do when I am bored, but I also want to swim in the ocean when the weather gets nicer (not during the next storm!). I also want to explore further east and compare that to Cathays or Roath. In Wales, I want to practice my Welsh with someone from North Wales (as we are learning Southern Welsh) and visit Snowdonia, one of the wettest places. In the UK, I want to visit a couple of iconic cities, such as Bath, Liverpool, Manchester, and especially spend a weekend in London. Here's to hoping I can see at least some of these places at some point!</p>
      <h3>My first impressions</h3>
    <p>My first impressions of Cardiff and the UK are that it is like being in a dream; where everything is very vaguely familiar but somewhat different and you can't put your finger on it. I love living here and noticing the small differences between American and Welsh culture. One of the things that surprised me the most was how enthusiastic Brits are toward meeting Americans! I was very shocked because I thought Americans were looked down upon in other parts of the world. I guess I was happily proven wrong. I am very excited for what the future holds for me in Cardiff, and I cannot wait to share my experiences with my friends and family back at home.</p>
