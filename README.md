# COSC140 homework 1

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?
 
 I spent a good amount of time on this homework, probably between 3-4 hours.
 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
  
  I am still getting used to structuring websites, and although this website isn't perfect by far, I am surprised at how much I was able to accomplish in this time. One thing I will still need help is trying to align elements together. For example, I wanted to include a second picture at the bottom, but due to inexperience, I wasn't sure how I could insert a second image that sort of fits in the negative space at the bottom. I've started to learn that a lot of CS is less about memorization and more about playing around with the elements. W3 is a lifesaver in that regard. I did like the list of requirements, but I think I would need a bit more experience working with the syntax before jumping straight into making a website. Another thing is that my website doesn't look very good when it is not in its own tab (for example the image to the right probably looks really bad, but it looks fine in its own window).

Well done.  If you want help to add the image or tweak any layout things, I'd be happy to help.
